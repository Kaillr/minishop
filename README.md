## üõ¢Ô∏èDatabase Concept Overview 

This document shows the concept for a shopping website database, including user information and a credit system.

### Tables

1. **Users Table**: Stores user information.
2. **Products Table**: Stores product details.
3. **Orders Table**: Stores information about user purchases.
4. **Credits Table**: Tracks user credits and transactions.

## SQL Statements

### Create Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_nameVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(320) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Create Products Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    stock INT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Create Orders Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    order_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);
```

### Create Credits Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Credits (
    credit_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    transaction_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    type ENUM('earned', 'spent') NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id)
);
```
### Create Shopping Cart Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE ShoppingCart (
    cart_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    product_id INT NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    added_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES Products(product_id)
);
```
### Create Images Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Images (
    image_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT,  -- Can be NULL initially, set later when product is added
    file_path VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,  -- Path or URL to the image
    upload_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES Products(product_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## Explanation of the Tables

- **Users Table**: 
  - `user_id`: Unique identifier for each user.
  - `password`: Password for account authentication (stored securely using hashing).
  - `email`: Unique email address for the user.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp for when the account was created.

- **Products Table**:
  - `product_id`: Unique identifier for each product.
  - `product_name`: Name of the product.
  - `description`: Description of the product.
  - `price`: Price of the product.
  - `stock`: Quantity available in stock.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp for when the product was added.

- **Orders Table**:
  - `order_id`: Unique identifier for each order.
  - `user_id`: Identifier of the user who placed the order.
  - `order_date`: Date and time when the order was placed.
  - `total_amount`: Total amount for the order.

- **Credits Table**:
  - `credit_id`: Unique identifier for each credit transaction.
  - `user_id`: Identifier of the user associated with the credit.
  - `amount`: Amount of credits earned or spent.
  - `transaction_date`: Date and time of the credit transaction.
  - `type`: Indicates whether the credits were earned or spent.

## Additional Considerations

- **Security**: Always hash passwords before storing them in the database.
- **Indexes**: Consider adding indexes to columns that are frequently queried, like `email`, and `product_name`, for better performance.

## Shopping Cart Functionality

To implement a shopping cart system, you need to create a mechanism to store products that users add to their cart before completing their purchase. Below are the modifications and SQL commands needed to incorporate a shopping cart into the existing schema.
